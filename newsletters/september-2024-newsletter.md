In March 2013, Bitcoin's value surged by 176%, climbing from **$33** to **$92** within a single month. This was just the beginning. Fast forward to today, and Bitcoin's price has reached **$56,000**—a stunning rise in value.

Back in 2013, I was a software engineer at **Saya Mobile Ltd.**, just having completed my internship and tech bootcamp at **Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST)**. Alongside my boss and mentor, **Bizzle**, the Chief Technology Officer of Saya Mobile, we navigated the early crypto landscape. Every payday, we embarked on a journey to convert “Liberty Reserve” dollars into “Perfect Money,” which we used to buy Bitcoin on the Russian exchange **btc-e.com**. At the time, Bitcoin was trading at around $13.

This routine changed drastically when the US government shut down btc-e.com and seized all the servers. However, the seeds of understanding Bitcoin’s potential were already planted.

Today, with Bitcoin valued at **$56,000**, it's clear that the early lessons learned have paid off. The future holds even greater potential, and **SatoshiDollarParity** is here to help you navigate this evolving digital currency landscape.
